I\u2019ve never been a Harry Potter fan myself \u2013 I was already out of kids\u2019 books when they first came out, and those clever grown-up covers weren\u2019t enough to tempt me back \u2013 but I\u2019d always admired JK Rowling from afar. Who wouldn\u2019t? A writer whose imagination transfixed the world, whose riches now exceed those of the Queen, but who has founded a children\u2019s charity, pays her taxes in full, and remains both poised and politically engaged: as role models go, it is hard to think of a better one. So I was pleased when my seven-year-old son went Harry Potter crazy. Having never read to himself before, he was suddenly racing through book after book, his bedside light on late into the night. His brother and several of his friends caught the bug \u2013 just as the Suez canal flowed through Clarissa Eden\u2019s drawing room, Hogwarts overshadowed our house, as children constantly dashed about on broomsticks, casting spells and looking for snitches. It was impressive to see the \u201cHarry Potter effect\u201d in action: the magical power that, in the two decades since its first publication, has revitalised the children\u2019s publishing industry, encouraged millions of children to read, sold more than 400m copies across the world, and generated a cultural empire worth \u00a320bn. Less pleasant, however, was the realisation that there was a marketing juggernaut poised to capitalise on my son\u2019s enthusiasm. Unlike those first readers 20 years ago, the children discovering Harry Potter now are immediately faced with a multibillion-pound industry trading in Potter-themed \u201cexperiences\u201d and paraphernalia.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

And it so happens that the papaya, with its little fruity neck and a central cavity full of seeds and pulp, is a serviceable approximation of a woman\u2019s cervix and womb for the purposes of basic initiation for a medic in training.

The prime minister set out her commitment to dealing with climate change in an article for the Guardian, echoing David Cameron\u2019s 2005 efforts to show the Tories cared about global warming. Ahead of this week\u2019s climate change summit in Paris, May said: \u201cThere is a clear moral imperative for developed economies like the UK to help those around the world who stand to lose most from the consequences of manmade climate change.\u201d She described coal as \u201cone of the dirtiest and most destructive ways of generating power\u201d and hailed the \u201cenormous commercial opportunity which the shift to cleaner forms of energy represents\u201d. May\u2019s commitment to the issue of climate change was questioned when she abolished the Department for Energy and Climate Change shortly after taking office last year. Later, her appointee as environment secretary, Andrea Leadsom, had to ask officials whether climate change was real. However, the prime minister insists \u201ctackling climate change and mitigating its effects for the world\u2019s poorest are amongst the most critical challenges the world faces\u201d. At the summit she will announce a \u00a3140m boost to funding for poorer communities affected by climate change through deforestation or vulnerability to natural disasters and extreme weather, plus \u00a315m of additional support for reconstruction on Dominica in the Caribbean, which was devastated by Hurricane Maria in September. It comes at a time when Conservative MPs are being asked by party officials to show off their green credentials after internal polling showed the level of concern among younger voters about environmental issues. The party has been alarmed by the backlash against May\u2019s support for a free vote on foxhunting, the omission of a ban on the ivory trade from the manifesto and its lack of support for an amendment that would have recognised in UK law that animals feel pain. They have since backtracked on all three issues.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Putin said a significant part of Russian forces would be withdrawn from Syria, though scepticism was warranted given that two previous announcements have been met with little noticeable scaling down. This time, however, could be different. Talk of the total defeat of Isis may be premature, but there is no doubt that Russian air power, combined with Syrian forces and Iran-backed Shia militias on the ground, has decisively shifted the balance of power in the long Syrian civil war. President Bashar al-Assad was on the brink of defeat when Russia entered the conflict in 2015. With sustained airstrikes on both moderate rebel groups and extremists, Moscow has helped Assad win back control of much of the country. The Russian and Syrian air forces were accused of brutal bombing tactics, including deliberately targeting civilian infrastructure, which the Russian military has always denied. Assad\u2019s departure from office, long demanded by western powers, is no longer on the immediate agenda.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  There should be 1 paragraphs.

The prime minister made a concession on Monday by agreeing to set up a new committee of MPs to monitor any proposed legal changes as EU legislation is converted into the British statute book. She had been facing a parliamentary defeat over the issue during the debate on the EU withdrawal bill on Tuesday, after a widespread backbench revolt among remain- and leave-supporting MPs. However, the government has not backed down on its intention to fix the day of Brexit as 29 March 2019 or acceded to the demands of soft Brexit Tory MPs who wanted a meaningful vote on the terms of the final deal before that date. One Conservative rebel said May was in trouble over these two issues because there were enough dissatisfied Conservatives combined with Labour, SNP, Liberal Democrat and other opposition MPs to defeat the government. The MP said the government and the rebels were currently in a standoff with neither side prepared to back down. However, government sources were confident May had managed to convince enough of her backbenchers not to defy the whip by indicating that a vote was likely to happen well before the date of leaving and promising a second vote on legislation implementing the EU withdrawal agreement hammered out in Brussels on Friday. The appetite for rebellion among Conservative MPs will become clearer during the two days of debate and voting on the EU withdrawal bill on Tuesday and Wednesday. Up to 25 had threatened to revolt unless May promised more scrutiny over Brexit lawmaking, but No 10\u2019s concessions appear to have allayed concerns among the would-be troublemakers. The government will agree to establish a new committee of MPs to help weed out the overuse of \u201cHenry VIII powers\u201d, which allow ministers to make changes to secondary legislation as it is transposed.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

The US president refused in October to continue to certify the 2015 multilateral agreement under which Tehran accepted strict curbs on its activities in return for sanctions relief. Trump said that either Congress or US allies should fix the \u201cserious flaws\u201d in the deal, or he would \u201cterminate it. The Senate has since opted out of dealing with the matter, and Washington\u2019s allies have insisted that the 2015 agreement cannot be renegotiated. If Trump refuses to sign a six-monthly presidential waiver due on 15 January, nuclear-related sanctions against Iran will no longer be suspended and the US will be in violation of agreement. The other signatories, including the UK, France, Germany, Russia and China, would then have to decide whether to try to carry on without the US or allow the agreement to collapse. Either way, the Trump administration would have taken a very significant step toward open confrontation.

Football fanatics need not panic: polls show it\u2019s still far ahead of both baseball and basketball in popularity. The 2017 NBA finals averaged 20.4m viewers (a 20-year record), which is roughly the same as the NFL\u2019s regular Sunday night audience of 20.3m, and nowhere near the 2016 Super Bowl \u00fcber-audience of 111m. Based on just those numbers, football is still kicking professional basketball, baseball and hockey through the goal posts. But America can be fickle. And the Magic 8-Ball of our cultural zeitgeist says, \u201cAll signs point to the NBA replacing the NFL as the league of America\u2019s future.\u201d This prediction has nothing to do with the athletes themselves, their level of skill, their heart, or their commitment to their sport. Professional athletes are generally the highest expression of what the human body is capable of doing and therefore inspiring to the fans to reach higher and strive harder. In that way, no sport is superior to any other sport. But when it comes to professional sports, some are more inspirational, more exciting and more entertaining to the general public than others and those sports take on a symbolic meaning for Americans.

Viewers saw the best of him in Multi-Coloured Swap Shop (BBC1, 1976-82) and its successor, Saturday Superstore (1982-87), on which Chegwin became an honorary big brother to several generations of goggle-eyed British children, through his cheeky grin and giggle, high-pitched Liverpudlian-accented enthusiasm, and psychedelic knitwear. His presentational worst occurred when Chegwin threw off the novelty sweaters \u2013 and, indeed, all clothing except a hat \u2013 to front the naturist show Naked (Channel 5, 2000), described by a parliamentarian at the time as the \u201cmost disgusting programme ever shown\u201d on British TV. But, while he should be remembered for the work he did with his jolly jumpers on, it was hard not to feel some sympathy for Chegwin, even in his most desperate televisual enterprises. This was due to a natural likability. Only the most sympathetic TV presenters earn nicknames from viewers, and, just as Bruce Forsyth transmuted into \u201cBrucie\u201d, Chegwin rapidly and indelibly became \u201cCheggers\u201d. That identity was cemented by the title of the third huge success of his children\u2019s career: the music-based gameshow, Cheggers Plays Pop (BBC1, 1978-86), which extended his presenting empire to weekdays. In less prosperous times, though, audiences also admired the impressive and affecting determination with which Cheggers, in the three decades after his Saturday morning career ended, tried to reinvent himself, often against considerable odds. In addition to a common problem for children\u2019s presenters \u2013 becoming too old to maintain the required fantasy-sibling dynamic \u2013 Chegwin suffered health problems, including alcoholism. Apart from the established presenter-rehab route of reality TV \u2013 appearing on Dancing on Ice, Celebrity Big Brother and Celebrity MasterChef \u2013 Chegwin also offered ironic spins on his showbiz rise and fall in 10 projects, including Ricky Gervais\u2019s Extras and Life\u2019s Too Short, and Kill Keith (2011), an improbable comedy-horror Brit film spoof of Tarantino\u2019s Kill Bill.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

A three-year-old girl was said to be in a critical condition on Monday afternoon, while a woman, 35, who is understood to be the children\u2019s mother, was in a serious condition. Police are yet to formally identify the victims, but the mother and her 14-year-old daughter have been named locally as Michelle Pearson, 35, and Demi Pearson. Drew Povey, the headteacher at Harrop Fold school in Little Hulton, where Demi was a pupil, said: \u201cWe are devastated at the tragic loss of life today in our community. Our thoughts and prayers are with the family involved.\u201d Greater Manchester police said they had arrested three men, aged 23, 20 and 18, and a 20-year-old woman on Monday on suspicion of murder. A 24-year-old man is also being questioned in custody on suspicion of assisting an offender. Police had previously urged a murder suspect to hand himself in, saying there was \u201can active manhunt\u201d to find an individual who they did not name. \u201cAll I would say is he knows who he is and he should give himself up immediately,\u201d said Ch Supt Wayne Miller.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Under the plans, everybody in England would be presumed to be happy to donate their organs on their death, unless they have signed up to a register stating that they do not want that to happen. In practice, however, it is unlikely that organs would be taken against the wishes of the family. The government\u2019s ambition to change the NHS organ donation programme was announced by Theresa May in her Conservative party conference speech in October. Last year, she said, \u201c500 people died because a suitable organ was not available. And there are 6,500 on the transplant list today.\u201d NHS Blood and Transplant\u2019s figures show that 1,100 families in the UK decided not to allow organ donation because they were unsure, or did not know whether their relatives would have wanted to donate an organ or not. \u201cEvery day, three people die for want of a transplant, which is why our historic plans to transform the way organ donation works are so important. We want as many people as possible to have their say as we shape the new opt-out process,\u201d said Hunt. \u201cAs well as changing the law, we also need to change the conversation \u2013 it can be a difficult subject to broach, but overcoming this fatal reluctance to talk openly about our wishes is key to saving many more lives in the future.\u201d The consultation will ask three questions: how much say should families have in their deceased relative\u2019s decision to donate their organs? When would exemptions to \u201copt-out\u201d be needed, and what safeguards will be necessary?\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.  Answer with less than 271 words.

Yet Bruni surprised her detractors, showing herself to be a talented songwriter and a careful, nuanced singer whose jazzy chansons soon topped the French charts. She has continued to do so, even after the inevitable hiatus to her musical career caused by marrying Nicolas Sarkozy, and spending 2008-12 in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e as France\u2019s first lady. She has spoken of suffering from crippling stage fright, but this still-gamine figure, fronting a four-piece, light-jazz band, exudes preternatural poise. Bruni moves with beatific grace, recalling Karl Lagerfeld\u2019s praise of her as \u201cthis beautiful creature who can wear anything\u201d; her husky whisper could be a parody of a breathy Gallic siren. Her latest album is a set of cover versions sung in English, French Touch, which is a decidedly mixed bag. It largely works because Bruni pours herself into the songs as if in thrall to them: her pitch-perfect, sparse croon through Depeche Mode\u2019s Enjoy the Silence identifies and amplifies the bleak yearning at the song\u2019s core. The quirky arrangements can be eccentric. Bruni\u2019s cod-jazz take on Willie Nelson\u2019s Crazy veers near to lift muzak, while the jaunty noodling her band introduce to Lou Reed\u2019s Perfect Day sounds at odds with the song\u2019s dark soul. The Clash\u2019s Jimmy Jazz is transformed into a previously unknown genre that can only be described as ethereal boogie-woogie.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

However, the film looks set to face strong opposition from Steven Spielberg\u2019s Pentagon Papers drama The Post and Martin McDonagh\u2019s Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, at a Globes ceremony that will provide the entertainment industry with its first major opportunity to respond to the sexual abuse scandal plaguing Hollywood. Two months after the emergence of allegations against producer Harvey Weinstein that would prompt a further torrent of claims against men in the film industry, the nominations exhibited an already changed landscape in Hollywood. As expected none of the Weinstein-produced films eligible for inclusion received nominations, however there were multiple nominations for Ridley Scott\u2019s All the Money in the World, which was forced to replace star Kevin Spacey at short notice, after he was accused of multiple counts of sexual assault and harassment. At the same time, the widely predicted shift towards a more female-focused list of nominees in the wake of the Weinstein scandal did not materialise. Though there were nods for a number of films with female protagonists, including The Shape of Water, Three Billboards, I, Tonya, a biopic of disgraced ice skater Tonya Harding and coming-of-age comedy-drama Lady Bird, there was no room in the nominees for any female directors, while Patty Jenkins\u2019s feminist superhero movie Wonder Woman was snubbed entirely. Leading the way with seven nominations is the Shape of Water, which stars British actor Sally Hawkins as a mute cleaner at a governmental research facility who falls in love with a captured sea creature. Both Del Toro and Hawkins have been nominated in the drama category, for best director and best actress respectively, while Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer have received supporting actor and actress nominations. The film has also received best screenplay and score nominations, as well as best picture in the drama category. It is joined in that latter category by 70s-set drama The Post, which stars Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep as Washington Post higher-ups who clash over whether to publish classified documents about the war in Vietnam.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

If that was all there were to the lesson, it would be a hands-on class in art history. But the art teacher asks the students to cut up their paintings and build 3D sculptures out of the pieces.

From her salon at the centre of the cosmopolis, marvellously at one with her books and her learning, she considered, renamed and renewed our relationship with camp, with photography, with illness: a living legend of braininess and cool. Sontag, was not, though, as her editor Benjamin Taylor admits in the introduction to this gathering of stories from across her career, a committed short-story writer. She turned to the form in order to evade what Chekhov called \u201cautobiographophobia\u201d, which Taylor uses to mean the fear of writing and reflecting directly about one\u2019s life. Evading this fear, Sontag clearly found the name \u201cstories\u201d very helpful: half of them are pure autobiography. \u201cPilgrimage\u201d, for example, which opens the volume, is a memoir of Sontag\u2019s youth in southern California, and an account of her visit with a boyfriend to the home of an ageing Thomas Mann. The only reason why this did not become an essay, it seems, is that the encounter was dull and disappointing, and so difficult to reflect on: Mann had \u201conly sententious formulas to deliver. And I uttered nothing but tongue-tied simplicities, though I was full of complex feeling. We were neither of us at our best.\u201d The next piece, \u201cProject for a Trip to China\u201d, is also memoir: we learn more about Sontag\u2019s childhood (she was a voracious reader and dug deep holes in the garden to sit in); about her habit of ordering ambitiously in restaurants (hundred-year-old eggs); and a little about her father, who worked in China.

There are few holidays more dedicated to tearing up the five-a-day-guidelines than this one, so if you take away not only the meat but the cream, then what\u2019s left? Actually, this year there\u2019s a lot left, as supermarkets are increasingly wise to the idea that plenty of vegans want to stuff their faces, too. With estimates that between 2 and 12% of British people now follow a vegetarian diet, it\u2019s unsurprising that a vegetarian Christmas is well catered for by shops, but the rise of the \u201cflexitarian\u201d means that even non-vegans may buy and try vegan now, if it\u2019s an option. It takes a bit of supermarket-hopping and a familiarity with an online checkout to do it, but with a little effort, there\u2019s now a gluttonous array of choice. Christmas dinner is a roast with bits added on, and the majority of a roast is vegan anyway. There are a few tweaks that may need to be made \u2013 use oil to roast the potatoes instead of fat; swap butter for olive oil in the mash, and leave honey off the parsnips and carrots (you could swap in maple or agave syrup for sweetness). When it comes to the star of the show, the amount of effort you\u2019re willing to put in will dictate your centrepiece. The ever-reliable Linda McCartney range\u2019s new \u201croast beef\u201d joint comes with a boozy-tasting red wine glaze and a remarkably beef-like flavour, which is great for vegans who like the taste of meat but not the methods, though it may be too meaty for some. Fry\u2019s soy and quinoa Country Roast is a solid herby veggie roast, while Tofurky\u2019s turkey and stuffing is a respectable substitute for the real thing.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

A distinguished academic whose many books include the bestselling Europe: A History, Davies\u2019s itinerary \u201cwas not dictated by any principle other than keeping on the move in the general direction of the sunrise\u201d. Twelve of the 16 chapters focus on a place \u2013 these range from Baku in Azerbaijan, where Asia and Europe overlap, to Cornwall. Four chapters are thematic. Davies\u2019s goal, he said, was roughly akin to that of Goethe\u2019s \u201cschool of seeing\u201d: \u201cTo test my powers of observation, to spot the recurring themes and catch the fleeting details. And then to tell the story.\u201d His themes include the history, and subsequent marginalisation, of indigenous peoples. The sections on the first inhabitants of Tasmania are particularly gripping. Linguistic revival and language in general fascinate this author, too. He uses Chinese characters and Japanese kanji to illuminate toponyms of those countries and includes a section on Tahitian nature words.

With the return to surplus built on income tax revenue, any income tax cuts are unlikely to come before the next decade without either increases in other taxes or big cuts to government services. Amid the usual \u201cfree markets are great\u201d rah-rah that the prime minister doled out to the Business Council of Australia on Monday night, Malcolm Turnbull also slipped in a line on income tax cuts, noting that he was: \u201cActively working with the treasurer and all my cabinet colleagues to ease the burden on middle-income Australians, while also meeting our commitment to return the budget to surplus.\u201d This was a bit of a surprise given the current state of the budget is such that the government is projecting that a return to surplus only in 2020-21and that net debt at that point will total $366bn, or 17.6% of GDP. Even in the best of times, promising income tax cuts as the budget is in deficit is a courageous position to take for a political party that likes to prides itself on \u201cbudget responsibility\u201d.It is even more courageous when the path back to surplus is built on a foundation of income tax revenue. Individual\u2019s income tax has always been the biggest tax in the budget. During the mining-boom years it declined slightly in importance as company tax exploded in value from 3.3% of GDP in 1998-99 to5.3% of GDP in 2005-06. But in the current financial year, individual income tax accounts for just over half of all tax revenue. Now that in itself is a bit of a problem (the IMF and OECD have made calls for Australia to lessen its reliance on income tax) but it is a bigger problem for Turnbull and his call for tax cuts while also \u201cmeeting our commitment to return the budget to surplus.\u201d The issue it that of the extra $88.1bn in tax revenue the government hopes to gain between now and 2020-21, $48.5bn of it is to come from individual income tax. This means that income tax is actually bearing a greater burden of the increase in tax than would be expected. Income tax makes up 50.6% of total tax revenue, but accounts for 55% of the increase in tax revenue between now and 2020-21.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

The 22-year-old is the youngest daughter of the Perth mining billionaire Michael Wright, whose father, Peter Wright, was a business associate of the late Lang Hancock. He was worth $2.7bn upon his death in 2012. Mead was not publicly connected to the powerful Wright family or her half-siblings until she challenged her father\u2019s will, arguing that it did not adequately provide for her needs. She had originally been bequeathed a $3m trust fund that she would be able to access once she turned 30, provided she did not become an alcoholic, be convicted of a crime, knowingly have \u201cany involvement or association whatsoever\u201d with illicit drugs, or convert to any faith other than \u201ctraditional\u201d Christian options. The supreme court found in Mead\u2019s favour in early 2015 and increased her inheritance eight-fold to $25m, an amount the court\u2019s master, Craig Sanderson, said would \u201cnot fall outside of the reasonable expectation of most members of the community\u201d. It was more than the $20m Mead had demanded, which her lawyers had revised down to $12m before the surprise decision. Wright\u2019s estate, acting on behalf of Wright\u2019s much older children from his second marriage, filed an appeal one month later. On Wednesday, the full bench of the Western Australian supreme court set aside Sanderson\u2019s orders, ruling that while Sanderson was correct to say that Mead had been inadequately provided for in the original will: \u201cThe exercise of his discretion to order that provision be made for the respondent in the sum of $25m was flawed.\u201d In a lengthy written judgment, the court found that Sanderson made a number of \u201cmaterial errors\u201d in calculating the size of Mead\u2019s inheritance, saying the focus should have been on what constituted \u201cproper maintenance\u201d and that the initial finding that Mead was \u201chonest\u201d and \u201cnot a gold-digger\u201d were not relevant. \u201cThe capital sum should be sufficient to enable the respondent to purchase a reasonably substantial house with part of the capital sum and to invest the balance so that she will receive a reasonably substantial annuity for the remainder of her life,\u201d the appeal court\u2019s president, Michael Buss, said.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Lu Wei was the powerful and flamboyant head of the Cyberspace Administration of China from 2014 until June 2016 and he came to personify China\u2019s model for internet control. He travelled to the United States, meeting with the CEOs of Facebook, Amazon and Apple, and held court when tech titans visited China. Lu was being investigated for \u201cserious disciplinary violations\u201d, a euphemism for graft, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said on its website. He stepped down from running the Cyberspace Administration in 2016, leading to rumours he had fallen out of favour. President Xi Jinping has led a far reaching anti-corruption drive since coming to power five years ago and has said graft is the paramount threat to the ruling Communist party. The campaign has seen nearly 1.4m party members punished and Xi vowed to continue rooting out graft during his second five-year term which began last month. Critics say elements of the anti-graft campaign have been used to eliminate Xi\u2019s enemies and root out political factions that oppose him. Lu is the most prominent official to fall since Xi\u2019s second term began and the anti-corruption agency pointed to Lu\u2019s case as a sign the drive will continue. \u201cLu Wei being investigated by the organisation is the best proof of this determination and resolve,\u201d the agency said in a commentary.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

With Queenslanders preparing to head to the polls on Saturday, no clear victor has emerged, leaving both the LNP and Labor scrambling to bed down seats. Labor has consolidated its message to one line \u2013 \u201ca clear choice\u201d \u2013 as it seeks to highlight what it says will be the \u201ccuts and chaos\u201d under a Tim Nicholls-led government.

Miller and Labor have maintained it was a coincidence of the campaign and a \u201ccommon decency\u201d to present a gift for a new baby.

The federal opposition leader, Bill Shorten, cut his ties to the magpie, currently coming second, and set his sights on the emu (whose image sits above Parliament House), in what must surely be an early election pitch. The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, chose the Gang-gang cockatoo, another Canberra icon (\u201cIncredible plumage but it sounds like a rusty door\u201d), while fellow senator Nick McKim picked the wedge-tailed eagle, and Janet Rice, the hooded plover. Scott Ludlam, 2017\u2019s first dual citizen, again displayed divided loyalties. The former senator endorsed the Carnaby\u2019s black cockatoo at 3.45pm on Monday, but by 8.30pm, he suddenly declared himself \u201cTeam Bin Chicken\u201d. Malcolm Turnbull, the prime minister, was asked but did not respond, opening himself up to a string of less-than-flattering replies. But the government\u2019s leader of the house, Christopher Pyne, did tell ABC Radio\u2019s Patricia Karvelas he liked the black-faced spoonbill.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

At a gala dinner in Canberra on Tuesday, Rinehart gave the inaugural agricultural and related industries award to Joyce, describing him as a \u201cchampion of the industry\u201d. Labor immediately took aim at the award, with the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, labelling it a \u201c$40,000 cash present\u201d. Joyce has said he will refuse the cash. The Nationals leader, a close personal friend of Rinehart and former agriculture and water minister, is currently battling for his political life in the New England byelection after the high court ruled him ineligible to sit in parliament because of dual New Zealand citizenship.
