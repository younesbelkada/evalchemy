Using footage only recently rediscovered in the National Geographic archive, octogenarian Jane Goodall recollects her first field study of chimpanzees in the wild in Tanzania. This was the 1960s, and Goodall was a 26-year-old typist with no academic training. Yet on that trip she made a great leap in scientific research by observing chimps making and using tools. Goodall says that it was her mother who built her self-esteem when she was growing up \u2013 encouraging her to see beyond the expectations that a nice, middle-class girl from Bournemouth should get married and start a family. Instead, she dreamed of living with animals in the jungle like Tarzan. There are more than 40 documentaries about Goodall. What makes this one \u2013 directed by Brett Morgen, who made The Kid Stays in the Picture \u2013 essential, is Goodall\u2019s reflective mood and the wondrous 16mm archive footage shot by Hugo van Lawick, the great wildlife photographer National Geographic sent to film her in Tanzania. The pair fell in love and married (though in the end, Goodall\u2019s happy-ever-after was with the chimps not Van Lawick). One of his miraculous shots, of the annual great migration from Serengeti \u2013 a medley of animals gathered together like some majestic parliament of beasts \u2013 drew a gasp of wonder from a gentleman sitting behind me.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

Do they bring real-life experiences to those highly choreographed moments when they\u2019re leaping with ecstasy, racked by grief or, as in the climax of Stravinsky\u2019s Rite of Spring, dancing themselves to death on behalf of a fearful, threatened community? These are some of the questions posed by Goat, the raw, funny and occasionally searing new piece of dance theatre that Ben Duke has made for Rambert. The setting is an ambiguous space that is part meeting hall, part performance arena, and its \u201ccharacters\u201d are a group of dancers and musicians who have gathered to enact some kind of cathartic emotional ritual. Miguel Altunaga plays a reporter sent to describe it, and the tone at first is wickedly funny as Altunaga \u2013 a pitch perfect combination of intrusive and bewildered \u2013 tries to make sense of what\u2019s happening. \u201cAmazing energy,\u201d he pronounces as the group rock through a happy-clappy ensemble. Then as the group divide into individual solos, contorting their bodies into expressions of private feeling, he trails after the dancers, hoping for elucidation. One of them, her limbs tied into an agonised knot, explains breathlessly that she\u2019s dancing about the \u201cstigma of addiction\u201d. Another, his eyes rolling back in his head with exertion, says he\u2019s expressing a sense of betrayal.

Following another day of debate about the bill, which seeks to transpose EU statute into UK law post-Brexit, the government faced possible defeat over amendments intended to maintain the scope of the EU charter on fundamental rights. Several of the amendments were tabled by Dominic Grieve, the Tory former attorney general and a leading Brexit rebel, with speculation that enough of his fellow Tories would back some of these to inflict defeat. However, the solicitor general, Robert Buckland, said the government was willing to work with Grieve to see how rights under the charter could be kept after Brexit, and would introduce its own amendment to this effect later in the bill\u2019s passage. Grieve said this was sufficient reassurance for him and that he would not press for a vote on his amendments. Ken Clarke, another leading Conservative Brexit rebel, refused to guarantee he would not press for a vote on one amendment, which would allow Britons to mount legal challenges under the charter after Brexit, to which he was the second signatory after Grieve. However, with Grieve backing away, the chances of a government defeat were notably lessened if a vote was called. Buckland said he did not fully agree with Grieve\u2019s amendment, which would allow challenges to EU law retained after Brexit \u201con the grounds that it is in breach of general principles of EU law\u201d, and questioned whether it would add anything \u201cthat is relevant or material\u201d to existing rights. But Buckland said: \u201cLet me say that we do recognise the strength of views from my right honourable friend and, indeed, from other honourable members and honourable friends on this issue \u2013 many of whom have spoken this afternoon. \u201cWe\u2019re listening, and we are prepared to look again at this issue to make sure that we are taking an approach that can command the support of this house.\u201d Buckland said he would happily discuss a way forward with Grieve, \u201cand agree to work together with us in this shared endeavour\u201d, which would result in a government amendment in the report stage, the next part of the bill\u2019s passage through the Commons.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

{"follow_all_instructions": false, "follow_instruction_list": [true, false], "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:number_words", "detectable_format:title"], "prompt": "The following are the beginning sentences of a news article from the Guardian.\n-------\n In 1612, a contemporary of Shakespeare\u2019s, the playwright Thomas Heywood, published An Apology for Actors, in which he expressed a patriotic sentiment about the English language, boastful at the time, which now seems unexceptional: Our English tongue, which hath been the most harsh, uneven and broken language of the world... is now continually refined, every writer striving in himself to add a new flourish unto it; so that it is grown into a most perfect and composed language. The coming of age of English at the beginning of the 17th century, after a golden generation of extraordinary growth and innovation, is symbolised by the publication of a landmark edition that the playwright himself had never bothered with in his own lifetime. Indeed, it was not until seven years after his death, thanks to the First Folio, that his work began slowly to acquire the canonical status it enjoys today. Towards the end of November 1623, the bookseller Edward Blount, who traded at the sign of the Black Bear near St Paul\u2019s, finally held in his hands the text of a great volume for which he had long been waiting: Mr William Shakespeares Comedies, Histories &amp; Tragedies. Published according to the True Originall Copies. In the words of one critic: \u201cIt is hard to overstate the importance of this literary, cultural and commercial moment.\u201d The book now known as the First Folio (the first authoritative edition of Shakespeare\u2019s plays) established \u201cShakespeare\u201d for all time and it did this in two principal ways. First, it collects some 36 plays, including 18 scripts (notably Macbeth, Julius Caesar, As You Like It and The Tempest) which would be otherwise unknown. The trove of work thus assembled gave posterity not just a cast of immortal characters (Bottom, Falstaff, Lear, Portia, Jaques, Prospero et al), but also a heap of new words (including, for example, catastrophe, exaggerate, assassinate, indifference, monopoly and paradox). Second, it definitively connects his contemporary Ben Jonson (who declared his rival to be \u201cthe soul of the age\u201d) and some of the actors who had first performed these plays with the historical person, the playwright himself, a figure helpfully illustrated by a famous frontispiece, the engraved portrait of the artist that has become an icon of \u201cShakespeare studies\u201d. Other facts about the First Folio, a canon of incomparable power and authority, and the text that would help launch Shakespeare\u2019s global literary afterlife are indisputable: both its value (somewhere north of $5m in rare books\u2019 sales) and its comparative rarity (approximately 240 copies survive worldwide in public and private collections).\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

The long-anticipated verdict was previously delayed for half an hour after Mladic asked the judge if he could take a short bathroom break. The delay was extended as rumours began to circulate that the former Bosnian Serb commander, who had appeared healthy when sitting in court, had suddenly been taken ill. As he entered the ICTY courtroom, Mladic had infuriated relatives of the victims as gave a broad smile and gave a thumbs up to the cameras. Mladi\u0107, who was commander of the Bosnian Serb army during the 1992-95 Bosnian conflict and for several years was one of the world\u2019s most wanted fugitives, is now 74 and in poor health. His lawyers have argued he is not well enough to hear his verdict and sentence in person, but it is not clear whether they will seek a last-minute postponement. A judge has already rejected a defence effort earlier this month to have the judgment put off. The trial in The Hague, which took 530 days spread over more than four years, is arguably the most significant war crimes case in Europe since the Nuremberg tribunal, in part because of the scale of the atrocities involved. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) heard from 591 witnesses and examined nearly 10,000 exhibits concerning 106 separate crimes. Legal scholars say Mladi\u0107 is almost certain to be found guilty of genocide for the massacre at Srebrenica in July 1995, where more than 7,000 Muslim men and boys were killed, most by summary execution. The Bosnian Serb political leader, Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107, was convicted of genocide last year for his role in the Srebrenica killings.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

The Electoral Commission has noted, in documents seen by the Guardian, that Darren Grimes, who was 23 at the time, was apparently able to coordinate large sums to be spent with a social media marketing firm before receiving official confirmation of the amounts Vote Leave were intending to give him. Vote Leave, Grimes and a third group, Veterans for Britain, are under investigation by the election regulator over referendum spending. It was not against election rules for Vote Leave to donate to Grimes or other third parties as long as the spending was not coordinated. The watchdog reopened its investigation after an early decision not to take action was due to be challenged in a judicial review next month. A document submitted by the commission as part of the review process reveals the relationship between Vote Leave and Grimes. It describes how Grimes told Vote Leave on 13 June last year he would like to use a donation offered at an unknown date the previous week on a digital campaign with Aggregate IQ. The referendum was held 10 days later. Vote Leave told Grimes on 14 June that it had decided to donate \u00a3400,000 to him, the day after Vote Leave itself received a \u00a31m donation, and Grimes provided his AIQ reference number for the payment to be made directly. \u201cIt appears Mr Grimes was in a position to make arrangements with AIQ to provide services to him on 13 June ... before receiving confirmation of the amount to be donated,\u201d the review said.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

But now researchers say they\u2019ve worked out why lefties are overrepresented in some elite sports but not others. The study, published in the journal Biology Letters, suggests that being left-handed is a particular advantage in interactive sports where time pressures are particularly severe, such as table tennis and cricket \u2013 possibly because their moves are less familiar to their mostly right-handed opponents, who do not have time to adjust. \u201cThe data suggests that the heavier the time constraints are operating in a sport, the larger the proportion of left-handers,\u201d said the study\u2019s author, Dr Florian Loffing of the University of Oldenburg in Germany. \u201cWe are less used to playing lefties, and [so] might end up in not developing the optimal strategies to compete with them.\u201d While it is thought that about 10-13% of the population is left-handed, it has long been noted that in certain interactive sports there is often a surprisingly high proportion of left-handers playing at elite levels. Southpaw stars have seen significant success in sport, with big names including baseball aces Sandy Koufax and Randy Johnson, cricketers Garfield Sobers and Mitchell Johnson and table tennis\u2019s Wang Nan and Kasumi Ishikawa. Previous research has punted a number of possible explanations, including that left-handers have more efficient connections between the two hemispheres of their brain. Others have suggested that lefties have the edge due to an element of surprise: since most players are right-handed, players will be more used to playing against right-handed partners. But the question remained: why did different sports show such different proportions of left-handed players? To probe the issue, Loffing collected the names and handedness of the top 100 or so players for badminton, squash, tennis, table tennis and \u2013 for men only \u2013 cricket and baseball, across six years between 2009 and 2014.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

It\u2019s problematic in a number of ways. Firstly, very little of it involves what most people would recognise as archaeology \u2013 digging up cultural material from the ground for study. Most of the material legacies of modern conflicts remain above ground and embedded in current society, necessitating a more anthropological, interdisciplinary approach. Secondly, the time periods under study are often within living memory, and often remain highly contentious within the affected regions.

That total comfortably beats the 931,000 copies of \u00f7 sold by Ed Sheeran since he released it in early March. Swift has kept all but four songs from Reputation off streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music, meaning that fans need to pay to download the album or buy it on CD if they want to hear it. She also, somewhat controversially, created a promotion where fans who bought multiple copies of the album increased their chances of getting tickets to her upcoming tour, thus further driving sales. Nielsen, which collates album sales data in the US, said that Reputation sold more copies than the rest of the top 200 albums put together. Swift\u2019s previous three albums have all sold more than a million copies in the US in their first week\u2013 a feat increasingly difficult to achieve as the popularity of downloads and CDs continues to wane. Her label Big Machine reported that a further 905,000 copies were sold worldwide, 84,000 of which were in the UK, which gives it the sixth-largest first week UK sales of the year, behind albums by Sam Smith, Liam Gallagher, Take That, Rag\u2019N\u2019Bone Man and Swift\u2019s friend Ed Sheeran, who sold 671,000 copies of \u00f7 in the first week of its release. Swift\u2019s impressive US total is still some way off the all-time first week sales record set by Adele in 2015, when her album 25 sold 3.37m copies in the US in its opening week. Forbes, meanwhile, has estimated that Swift is the third highest-earning female musician in 2017, dropping from the top spot last year when her earnings were driven by tour revenues from her previous album, 1989. She was estimated to have earned $44m (\u00a333m) this year, below Beyonc\u00e9, whose Formation world tour helped generate earnings of $105m (\u00a379m), and Adele, who earned $69m (\u00a352m).\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

According to the Financial Times, students working at the Foxconn plant, as part of a three month \u201cwork experience\u201d placement, were routinely working 11-hour days assembling the newest phone, breaking Chinese overtime laws in the process. Student labour is common, and legal, in manufacturing hubs in China. The students must be paid, and the placements must be voluntary, with the number of temporary workers swelling employment at the Zhengzhou factory threefold in the busiest time of the year, the paper reported. But, according to the Financial Times, such work experience should be limited to just 40 hours a week. Six high school students, out of a group of 3,000 from one vocational school sent to work at the factory, told the paper that those legal limits were exceeded. In a statement, Apple said: \u201cDuring the course of a recent audit, we discovered instances of student interns working overtime at a supplier facility in China. We\u2019ve confirmed the students worked voluntarily, were compensated and provided benefits, but they should not have been allowed to work overtime.\u201d \u201cAt this facility, student intern programs are short term and account for a very small percentage of the workforce.

The Commons public accounts committee said the subsidy contract for Hinkley Point C, agreed in 2016 after years of delays, would hit poorest households hardest. The power station is expected to cost billpayers \u00a330bn over the lengthy of the 35-year contract, adding \u00a310-\u00a315 to the average household energy bill. But an assessment by the committee concluded that no one in Whitehall was championing consumers\u2019 interests during negotiations with French company EDF Energy. The final bill for consumers was exacerbated by government not renegotiating the guaranteed power price for fear that EDF and its Chinese partner CGN would walk away from the project, which the MPs said was a questionable assumption. Officials agreed a price of \u00a392.50 per megawatt hour in 2013 but fossil fuel price projections fell between then and the contract being signed in 2016, pushing the cost to consumers up fivefold from \u00a36bn to \u00a330bn. At the time the Department of Energy and Climate Change \u2013 now the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy \u2013 did not consider a ceiling on the guaranteed price, the MPs were told. Meg Hillier, chair of the group of MPs, said: \u201cBillpayers have been dealt a bad hand by the government in its approach to this project.\u201d The criticism from the committee follows a damning report by the UK\u2019s spending watchdog, the NAO, which found the contract for Hinkley had locked consumers into a \u201crisky and expensive project\u201d. The NAO attacked the government for failing to explore alternative financing models, such as taking stake in the project, a criticism that the MPs echoed. The public accounts committee said it was also disappointed that the government appeared to have no plan in place to maximise the wider benefits of the project, beyond the clean power it will provide.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

Faiz Siddiqui alleges the \u201cinadequate\u201d teaching he received on the Indian special subject part of his modern history course resulted in him getting only a low upper second degree when he took his finals in June 2000 instead of a first or high 2:1. Siddiqui, 39, has blamed the situation on a number of members of staff being absent on sabbatical leave and a failure to find cover. He has also alleged that a tutor failed to submit medical information about him to examiners. He claims he would have become an international commercial lawyer if he had gained the top qualification at the end of his time at Brasenose College, and that his clinical depression and insomnia have been significantly exacerbated by his \u201cinexplicable failure\u201d. The legal battle between Siddiqui and Oxford has been ongoing for more than a year. Last year a judge allowed Siddiqui\u2019s action to proceed to be fully argued after Oxford claimed the case had no merit and had been brought outside the legal time limit. It was decided at the time that Siddiqui had a real chance of persuading a judge that the case was not time-barred or that it would be just for it to proceed in any event. At the high court in London on Tuesday, Siddiqui\u2019s barrister, Roger Mallalieu, told Mr Justice Foskett that in 2000 Siddiqui was a \u201cdriven young man\u201d aiming for a postgraduate qualification from an Ivy League university before a career at the tax bar in England or a major US law firm. \u201cWhilst a 2:1 degree from Oxford might rightly seem like a tremendous achievement to most, it fell significantly short of Mr Siddiqui\u2019s expectations and was, to him, a huge disappointment,\u201d Mallalieu said.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

Today, hardly anyone says anything else, not least because virtually all our dire predictions have become realities. Even public officials responsible for running and inspecting the NHS, who couldn\u2019t be seen for dust then (the heads of NHS England, NHS Improvement and the Care Quality Commission), are going public on the gravity of the situation and begging the chancellor to do something in this week\u2019s budget. Indeed, how could anyone say things are OK when, in response to an increase in the past seven years of at most 15% in A&amp;E attendances and admissions, waits in A&amp;E have gone up by 350% and waits for admission by 550%? Increasing waiting times are the canary in the mine. However, the Department of Health, whenever challenged with a another example of increasingly poor performance, excessive waits or other pressures, retorts not that this is incorrect but (without irony) that other things in the NHS are fine. In reality, all is not well. Once again, I am afraid, those who have just started to complain are saying too little and too late. The NHS isn\u2019t getting into crisis, as they cautiously say. It is way beyond that and already failing, despite its internationally accepted efficiency.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.  Answer with at least 109 words.

The disclosure has prompted calls for the regulator to stop companies passing the cost of a discredited medieval practice on to their customers. Ofwat said any firm failing to meet its commitments to customers faced a financial penalty. Dowsers, or water witchers, claim that their divining rods cross over when the presence of water is detected below ground. It is regarded as a pseudoscience, after numerous studies showed it was no better than chance at finding water. Some water companies, however, insisted the practice could be as effective as modern methods. The discovery that firms were still using water diviners was made by the science blogger Sally Le Page, after her parents reported seeing an engineer from Severn Trent \u201cwalking around holding two bent tent pegs to locate a pipe\u201d near their home in Stratford-upon-Avon. Le Page asked Severn Trent why it was still using divining rods to find pipes when there was no evidence that it worked. Replying on Twitter, the company said: \u201cWe\u2019ve found that some of the older methods are just as effective than the new ones, but we do use drones as well, and now satellites.\u201d Le Page then asked the other 11 water companies whether they were using water dowsing.

The chancellor of the exchequer stands up, conjures up the ghost of Sir Stafford Cripps, administers some pain and quickly moves on. In Westminster it is known as aligning the economic and political cycles. In plain English, it means getting the bad news out of the way early in order that there will be money to spare just before voters have to go to the polls again. Only rarely do governments deviate from this approach and when they do it rarely ends well. But these are not normal times. It is simply not possible for Philip Hammond to raise taxes in the hope that, given time, the public will have forgotten all about it. This is a minority government that might not go the distance and, rather like Denis Healey in 1974, Hammond has to prepare for the possibility that there will be another election before too long. What\u2019s more, the reason it might not survive until the scheduled end of the parliament in 2022 is that a good chunk of the public decided in June this year that it wanted more houses built, more money spent on the NHS, less-crowded trains and better roads \u2013 the things Jeremy Corbyn said they could have if the government was prepared to borrow to invest and to tax the rich more heavily. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, thinks the tide turned against austerity during the course of 2016, partly because the public wearied of cuts and partly because Labour articulated an alternative.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

And if there\u2019s one thing the Scots are good at, apart from politics, economics, terriers and whisky, it\u2019s an honest broth. According to the Victorian journalist and author Christian Isobel Johnstone, who published her The Cook and Housewife\u2019s Manual under the pseudonym Margaret Dods: \u201cThe French take the lead of all European people in soups and broths \u2026 the Scotch rank second, the Welsh next, and \u2026 the English, as a nation, are at the very bottom of the scale.\u201d As an Edinburgh native, she may have been biased, but when one considers the likes of cullen skink, Scotch broth and our subject here, cock-a-leekie, it\u2019s hard not to concede the point. The last, occasionally known as cockie-leekie, is often dated to the end of the 16th century, when the Lincolnshire-born traveller Fynes Moryson records having been served \u201cpullet with some prunes in the broth\u201d at a knight\u2019s house in Scotland, although, given the widespread medieval tradition of meat and fruit pottages, it seems likely that similar dishes were once found throughout northern Europe \u2013 even (horror!) south of the border. Happily for us, however, this particular version remained popular in Scotland, and feels a pleasingly simple and wholesome celebratory dish to prepare the stomach for the month to come. The chicken As ever, many recipes call for what the redoubtable Maw Broon calls \u201can auld boiling fowl\u201d (thanks to Twitter friend of the column Jon Dryden Taylor for supplying the recipe), which is, as we have seen previously, an appropriately tough thing to get hold of in 21st-century Britain. Catherine Brown reckons that \u201cattempting a modern cock-a-leekie with an immature battery chicken is akin to attempting cassoulet without confit\u201d, and, in the absence of decent chicken recommends using \u201ca more flavourful pheasant or other game bird \u2013 cock or hen \u2013 which has roamed freely\u201d. Having tried her recipe, I can confirm that pheasant makes a delicious soup, even when enjoyed from a bowl in a warm kitchen, rather than from a Thermos in the middle of a damp autumnal copse, but one with a distinct gamey character. Feel free to use pheasant here, if that\u2019s what you have, but chicken, to some extent the older the better, remains the classic choice.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

The show had opened with a straight news report on a story that now involved their own station. A CBS This Morning reporter related the facts that Rose, 75, had been suspended from his job while the company looks into detailed accusations from eight women that he had made unwanted sexual advances towards them, as revealed by the Washington Post. Allegations include lewd phone calls, walking around naked in their presence, or groping their breasts, buttocks or genital areas, and the women were employees or aspired to work for Rose at the Charlie Rose show from the late 1990s to 2011, the Post reported. \u201cIt takes a lot of courage for these women to come forward,\u201d said O\u2019Donnell.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

Her shows, for all their simplicity, can be hard to pin down, but her words are telling: \u201cI\u2019m always looking for the heart of a story,\u201d she says. This is a director who deals in feelings. To those not paying attention, Cookson landed like a bolt from the blue. Most directors cut through in their 30s, but she was in her 50s when her circus-heavy staging of Jacqueline Wilson\u2019s Hetty Feather was nominated for an Olivier award in 2015. Her calling card, however, was a magnificent, two-part Jane Eyre, a total theatre treat that translated Charlotte Bront\u00eb\u2019s book into movement and music, colour and light. Since its premiere at the Bristol Old Vic in 2014, more than 250,000 people have seen it on stage or on screen \u2013 possibly unprecedented for a piece of devised theatre. It\u2019s why, last year, Cookson got the National Theatre\u2019s Olivier stage for Christmas \u2013 arguably the biggest family slot of the year \u2013 to put on Peter Pan. This year, as a mark of her newfound bankability, Marianne Elliott\u2019s new commercial company has backed her to bring Narnia to life in Leeds.

Now researchers say the emotions people feel when drinking could be linked to their tipple of choice. An international survey has revealed that spirits are often associated with feelings of energy, confidence and sexiness \u2013 but on the flip-side anger and tearfulness \u2013 while red wine is the drink most commonly linked to relaxation, but also tiredness. While the researchers say the reasons for the links are likely to be complex, they hope the study will urge individuals to think carefully about the alcohol they consume. \u201cFrom a public health perspective a lot of the time we have focused on issues around cancer, heart disease and liver disease \u2013 but an important aspect is the balance of emotional outcomes that people are getting from alcohol,\u201d said Mark Bellis, co-author of the research from Public Health Wales NHS Trust. The study, published in the journal BMJ Open, is based on an anonymous online questionnaire that was completed by individuals aged between 18 and 34 who had drunk alcohol in the previous year. Part of an international survey on alcohol and drug use, the questions probed the type of alcohol drunk and associated emotions, and were asked in 11 different languages, with participants taking part from 21 countries around the world. The results, based on answers from almost 30,000 participants who had reported consuming both red and white wine as well as beer and spirits in the past year, reveal that certain types of alcoholic drink appear to be linked to particular emotions. Almost 53% of participants said drinking red wine made them feel relaxed \u2013 an emotion that was also linked to beer by nearly 50% of participants, and white wine by nearly 33%. By contrast, spirits were linked to feelings of confidence by just over 59% of participants, energy by more than 58% and sexiness by just over 42%.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

A GP practice manager for much of my early working life, I had taken a step back to raise my daughter. In 2003, Dad\u2019s health deteriorated, with heart problems and Parkinson\u2019s disease. My siblings helped and visited him when they could but I lived the closest and had more time, so it made sense for me to help out the most. I\u2019d always thought of care as helping people who need to be taken to the toilet or helped into bed each evening. What I was doing was sitting and talking, going to the supermarket or helping with housework. What I didn\u2019t see at that time was the truth in front of me, that I had actually been delivering relationship-led care and companionship. I feel privileged to have spent that time caring for Dad, and in many ways I got to know more about him over those five years than I might otherwise have done. It came completely naturally to me, but in my mind being a care worker was something very different, so after Dad passed away and I felt ready to get back to work, I discounted it.

Yet from poinsettias to potted Christmas trees, many of these festive favourites can be extremely hard to keep alive in the conditions of the average living room for just a few weeks, let alone year to year. There is, however, a really old-school, and often overlooked, seasonal houseplant that is made from much tougher stuff: the beautiful and exotic Christmas cactus (Schlumbergera truncata and S x buckleyi). These two species (which look so similar that they share a common name) hail from the cool mountains of southeastern Brazil, where they are pollinated by hummingbirds. Unusually for a cactus, they aren\u2019t a desert plant, but have adapted to grow on the boughs of tall rainforest trees, festooning their branches with weeping foliage and dazzling flowers. This relatively cool-weather habitat is surprisingly similar to the conditions of our British living rooms, making them perfectly adapted to thrive in hanging baskets or trail over windowsills everywhere. But what does a cactus have to do with Christmas? Not a great deal, really. In fact, in their native habitat their winter-flowering period doesn\u2019t even coincide with Christmas. However, fortunately for gardeners like me, their habit of bursting into the most spectacular of floral displays from November to January occurs just when I need it most.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

Now they\u2019ve given the green light to Theresa May to double her offer to settle our obligations to the EU, to a rumoured \u00a340bn. Meanwhile, tomorrow\u2019s budget is likely to confirm that the health service is being starved of funds. But that\u2019s not the end of the story. When the final Brexit bill comes in, it is likely to reach about \u00a380bn \u2013 double the prime minister\u2019s latest offer. Not that the government will come clean on this, as it is trying to head off a backlash by Tory backbenchers unhappy that even the \u00a340bn agreed at yesterday\u2019s Brexit cabinet subcommittee is too much. If they realised how much we are going to end up paying, they really would go \u201cbananas\u201d as one MP put it. The government is hoping to defuse opposition from within its own ranks by suggesting the money will come with strings attached: it will be conditional on the EU agreeing a good trade deal or, more realistically, at least agreeing to talk about a future trade deal. May\u2019s new offer could be enough to break the deadlock in the talks at next month\u2019s crucial summit \u2013 provided she doesn\u2019t say it\u2019s a \u201cfinal offer\u201d or add unrealistic conditions to it. After all, the other EU countries have said they will be prepared to move on to talking about our future relationship once \u201csufficient progress\u201d has been made on the three key divorce issues: money, citizens\u2019 rights and Ireland.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.
