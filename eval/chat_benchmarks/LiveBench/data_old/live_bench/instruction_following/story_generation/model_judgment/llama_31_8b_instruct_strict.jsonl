The minister, Brandon Lewis, told the Commons home affairs select committee that an extra 1,200 UK visas and immigration staff were being recruited to process an expected 3.5m applications from EU nationals over two and a half years. He also told MPs on Tuesday that he was optimistic that an agreement could be struck by Christmas on the rights of EU citizens in the UK in the Brexit negotiations. However, he declined to comment on reports that the Brexit inner cabinet had decided on Monday that the European court of justice could continue to play a role in guaranteeing their rights during a two-year transition period. The Home Office minister did confirm that those refused \u201csettled status\u201d and classed as non-EU nationals in Britain illegally could have their bank accounts frozen and face deportation before the hearing of any appeal in British courts. The 3million group, representing EU nationals in Britain, immediately questioned Lewis\u2019s claim that an agreement with the EU on \u201csettled status\u201d was likely before Christmas. \u201cWe wonder how. Major stumbling blocks still in place,\u201d they tweeted, noting continued differences over the role of the ECJ, over family reunification rights that could affect thousands, and regarding clarification that they should not face \u201chostile environment measures\u201d. Yvette Cooper, chair of the Commons home affairs committee, voiced scepticism that an extra 1,200 staff \u2013 of whom 700 had already been recruited \u2013 would be sufficient when the UK Visas and Immigration agency (UKVI) currently used 6,500 staff to process 3m visa applications a year.

This national rerelease is linked to the Grahame retrospective at BFI Southbank, in London. It is adapted from the hardboiled thriller by Dorothy B Hughes, changing her story and rehabilitating the male lead in one way, but in another, introducing a new strain of pessimism and defeat. Bogart is Dixon Steele, a boozy, depressive Hollywood screenwriter whose tendency to violence and self-hatred isn\u2019t helped by the fact that he hasn\u2019t had a hit in years. Like the directors, producers and actors he occasionally sees in bars, his best days were before the second world war. One night at a restaurant, his agent offers him a much-needed gig adapting some brainless bestseller and Dix shruggingly accepts. The wide-eyed hatcheck girl, Mildred (Martha Stewart), tells him she loves the book and, amused, Dix invites her back to his place to tell him what it\u2019s all about. Having established his intentions are gentlemanly, Mildred agrees. Whatever Dix\u2019s intentions may actually have been, they are blown out of the water when the pair of them run into his new neighbour as he is about to show Mildred across the threshold \u2013 on her way back to her own apartment.

The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) warned that the chancellor faced a long period of lower than expected wages growth that would dent tax receipts and push up borrowing. The cumulative effect over the life of the parliament would add \u00a390.5bn to the UK\u2019s debt pile and jeopardise Hammond\u2019s target of balancing the government\u2019s books by 2025, it said. The Treasury said that once the positive effects of an increase in employment and better than expected borrowing over the last year are taken into account, the net borrowing rise would be \u00a335bn, putting the chancellor in a position to reach his target of creating a surplus in the middle of the next decade. But some analysts said the OBR\u2019s revision failed to go far enough and it continued to overestimate the capacity of British businesses to invest in new equipment and processes to drive up productivity. They argued that the forecaster should have gone further and predicted that productivity growth \u2013 which measures the average output per hour worked \u2013 of almost zero over the last seven years would continue for another five years. Joanna Davies, a UK economist at Fathom Consulting, said the OBR\u2019s new forecast that productivity would increase at a rate of 1.1% until 2022 \u2013 almost half the 2.1% average seen in the 30 years before 2007 \u2013 still looked ambitious. She said the prospects for GDP growth would suffer a severe knock-on effect from lower productivity and a rapidly ageing population. \u201cOver the last five years, productivity growth has averaged just 0.3%,\u201d she said. \u201cCombined with UN projections for working-age population growth, the UK\u2019s trend rate of overall economic growth is probably somewhere in the range 0.5%-1% \u2013 around half the 1.5% assumed by the OBR.\u201d The OBR chair, Robert Chote, said GDP growth would not only be hit by lower productivity, but also a weaker than expected export sector that would fail to benefit significantly from the lower pound.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

An amendment to the European Union (withdrawal bill to transfer the EU protocol on animal sentience into UK law was defeated by 313 votes to 295 on 15 November, and since then a row has developed as to what the vote meant in practice. Describing some of the reporting on the vote as \u201cweird and dishonest\u201d, Tory MP Zac Goldsmith tweeted a clarification that the vote had been about the correct legal procedure for ensuring animal welfare standards \u2013 not on the principle of whether animals are sentient. Fellow Conservative Rachel Maclean, MP for Redditch country, posted a video to try and explain the confusion caused by what she said was \u201cfake news\u201d, stating that: \u201cThis government, and in fact all governments, are deeply committed to continuing to protect animals as sentient beings. That law is already written into our own law.\u201d Theresa May said at Wednesday\u2019s PMQs: \u201cWe recognise and respect that animals are sentient beings, and should be treated accordingly.\u201d Tory MP Hugo Swire republished on social media a letter he received from Michael Gove, the environment secretary, on the issue, adding: \u201cI do not believe that any MP thinks that animals do not have feelings or emotions.\u201d Nevertheless, the vote has triggered protests from animal rights groups, including multiple online petitions aimed at the House of Lords, UK parliament and Gove. Public figures including the presenter Sue Perkins have voiced strong criticism of MPs over the issue. Gudrun Ravetz, senior vice-president of the British Veterinary Association, commenting on the vote, said: \u201cIt is extremely concerning that a marginal majority of MPs have voted-down this seminal clause. This action undermines the government\u2019s previous promises that the UK will continue to be known for our high standards of animal health and welfare post-Brexit.\u201d However, Henry Smith, Conservative MP for Crawley, pointed out that EU law still allowed many practices across Europe that animal rights groups oppose. The amendment, proposed by the Green party co-leader Caroline Lucas, among others, had set out to specifically incorporate article 13 of title II of the Lisbon treaty into UK law. During debate on the amendment last Wednesday, Lucas pointed out that the origins of the clause began with the 1997 UK presidency of the EU and that from 1999 EU law had explicitly recognised that animals were sentient life forms.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

Dugdale rejected complaints from her Labour colleagues at Holyrood that taking part in the ITV reality show was akin to taking a second job, but admitted she would be well paid for it. Speaking to show-business reporters in Australia for the first time since her participation provoked a backlash from other Labour MSPs, Dugdale insisted the show would allow her to connect with voters. She said she had set aside three weeks\u2019 salary as an MSP for the Rock Trust homeless charity and not a motor neurone disease campaign as previously thought. Dugdale launched a @TeamKez Twitter feed on Wednesday morning, featuring a short video clip recorded before she left Edinburgh of her wearing a Rock Trust T-shirt, where she addressed her constituents, and by extension her Labour critics. She said in the film: \u201cI appreciate that to quite a few of my constituents, this is quite a controversial move. I know there will be people upset about it, that will question my priorities.\u201d Saying they deserved an explanation, she added: \u201cFirst and foremost, I\u2019m a Celebrity \u2026 Get Me Out of Here is a huge UK-wide television programme, with an audience into the millions. \u201cI think it\u2019s an amazing opportunity to talk to young people who watch this programme about politics, and \u2013 in particular \u2013 Labour values. The Daily Record, which employs her as a columnist, quoted her as saying: \u201cI have a record of giving money to charity.

Revealed by a report by Quartz, Google\u2019s Android system, which handles messaging services to ensure delivery of push notifications, began requesting the unique addresses of mobile phone masts (called Cell ID) at the beginning of 2017. The information was captured by the phone and routinely sent to Google by any modern Android device, even when location services were turned off and the sim card was removed. As a result Google could in theory track the location of the Android device and therefore the user, despite a reasonable expectation of privacy. A Google spokesperson said: \u201cIn January of this year, we began looking into using Cell ID codes as an additional signal to further improve the speed and performance of message delivery. \u201cHowever, we never incorporated Cell ID into our network sync system, so that data was immediately discarded, and we updated it to no longer request Cell ID.\u201d Google requested the Cell ID alongside what is called the mobile country code and mobile network code, which identify the country and mobile phone operator that the smartphone is using. That data is used to ensure the phone stays properly connected to Google\u2019s Firebase Cloud Messaging system, which handles the delivery of messages and notifications to the smartphone. A persistent connection is required for the system to work, but instead of staying constantly connected, the phone pings Google\u2019s servers at set intervals. The more pings, the greater the battery drain, so the data collected about the country and mobile networks is used to work out the the minimum number of pings required to stay connected without draining the battery \u2013 so called heartbeat analysis. The benefit of having the address of the mobile phone mast to ensure message service reliability is not clear, but through a process of triangulation \u2013 the same used to assist when a user is actively using location services \u2013 the position of the user can be revealed down to a roughly 400m radius at a minimum, and often much more accurately in urban areas.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

It is a delectably gentle, elegant, self-effacing performance. Riva plays a lovably scatty old lady called Marthe in this Tati-esque comedy from French writer-directors Dominique Abel and Fiona Gordon. The movie they have jointly devised, and in which they star, is a clever, funny and distinctly unworldly comedy with an insouciant line in visual humour. Fiona (Fiona Gordon) is a young goof from Canada who comes to Paris to visit her similarly away-with-the-fairies aunt Marthe (Riva). A mishap on the banks of, and then in, the Seine leads to an encounter with a romantic tramp called Dom (Dominique Abel). It\u2019s a classic French entertainment that could have been produced almost any time in the last 60 years.

The standoff began two weeks ago after Hunt\u2019s appearance on The Andrew Marr Show, when Hunt stated that the NHS had overseen \u201cthe biggest expansion of mental health provision in Europe\u201d. Little, best known for his role as Anthony in the sitcom The Royle Family, accused the health secretary in a tweet of \u201cknowingly lying\u201d to the public about statistics and told Hunt to sue him if he was wrong. Hunt, who last month rowed back on a claim to parliament of an increase of 30,000 mental health workers \u2013 43 times the actual figure \u2013 responded a week later with a string of statistics and \u201cdouble dared\u201d Little back to prove otherwise. He tweeted: The actor then posted a thread of more than 40 tweets rebutting the health secretary\u2019s claims, including statistics from an independent UK fact-checking charity, Full Fact. That thread has been shared more than 15,000 times. The argument has since rolled on. Hunt on Monday replied with a series of 26 tweets of his own (although losing the chronology in the middle of the thread, making it difficult to follow). \u201cNow I know you are a funny bloke and in politics a lot of insults are traded but the question is can you back up what is a very strong claim?\u201d he asked Little, referring back to his \u201clying to the public\u201d comment. \u201cTo fill the gap [in mental health staffing levels] we now have 8,000 MH nurses in training and have this Sept announced an increase in nurse training places overall by 25%.\u201d Hunt also quoted from a New York Times article from July, which has been corrected three times after the former shadow minister for mental health, Luciana Berger, challenged its contents.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

At a time when Ukraine has fallen off the media radar, this play by Natal\u2019ya Vorozhbit, translated by Sasha Dugdale, provides a powerful reminder of the bitterness of the war that led to Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014. In particular, it makes the point that women attracted by the dubious glamour of the military can also become casualties of the conflict. The play consists of six vignettes of violence. The first is far and away the best. A Kiev-based writer called Natal\u2019ya tells the story of a research trip she made to the battle zone a year after the siege of Donetsk airport and how she fell for her patriotic escort. It is good precisely because it is personal, moving and filled with a double guilt: that of the confidence-revealing storyteller and of a woman who found love in a region where men were blowing each other to bits with rocket launchers. Later scenes show teenage girls eagerly waiting for soldiers, a female medic transporting her lover\u2019s headless corpse and a young journalist outwitting her captor. Vorozhbit overdoes the point that the soldiers, for all their supposed heroism in the fight against separatists, either prove useless in the sack or reliant on oral satisfaction.

It is sponsored by a flat Earth research group, and Hughes plans a subsequent trip to try and observe the flatness of the Earth for himself.

The damning inspection report into Oakhill secure training centre, near Milton Keynes, was published on Tuesday as MPs heard that ministers had ordered G4S to set up an external inquiry into abuse allegations at Brook House, the immigration removal centre at Gatwick, which is also run by the private security firm. The joint report by the prison inspectors, with Ofsted and the Care Quality Commission, into Oakhill in September and October \u2013 when the centre was near capacity, with 75 boys aged 14 to 17 \u2013 finds \u201cno evidence that staff can adequately care and control this volume of young people\u201d. The report rates the youth prison as \u201cinadequate\u201d and says there has been an increase in fights and assaults since the last inspection in January; it records 330 assaults between March and August this year alone, with assaults against staff increasing, including against newly recruited staff, and some so serious they have led to people being taken to hospital. \u201cOne manager said that young people are carrying improvised weapons because they do not feel safe. This inhibits some staff from intervening because of the fear of a weapon, and this in turn reinforces the view of young people that staff cannot protect them, thereby continuing the cycle,\u201d the report says. The inspectors say that many of the recommendations from their January inspection have not been met and the centre has deteriorated in most respects, including to do with safety, care, education, resettlement and the \u201ceffectiveness of leaders and managers\u201d. They say that unacceptable behaviour, including swearing, intimidation and vandalism, is not being challenged by staff. Oakhill\u2019s newly appointed interim director, Lisette Saunders, said: \u201cWe take these findings very seriously. In the report Ofsted recognised that senior managers at Oakhill know what is required to bring the centre up to acceptable standards.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

In one of the most notorious incidents involving the actor and director, Gibson unleashed an antisemitic rant in 2006 against a police officer in Malibu, California, who had pulled him over for drunk driving. He accused Jews of being responsible for \u201call the wars in the world\u201d. He was convicted of driving under the influence.

In March he was cheered by his backbenchers after the UK avoided the recession predicted by many analysts following the Brexit vote last year. Employment was climbing and measures of consumer and business confidence, which plummeted after the referendum, had bounced back. But he was soon in deep trouble with his Tory colleagues for planning a one percentage point increase in national insurance on the self-employed and, in a humiliating U-turn, he was forced to ditch the whole idea. The election in June left Hammond further weakened. He needs to push through measures that improve the economy\u2019s productivity to have any chance of meeting his pledge to eliminate the UK\u2019s deficit by the mid-2020s, but is also facing pressing problems in public services, welfare provision and a housing market that has effectively locked a generation of young people out of home ownership. Economy What we know: The UK economy expanded by 1.7% in 2016 but registered just 0.5% growth in the first half of this year. The pace has improved since the summer largely due to improving growth rates in Europe and the US, but the outlook remains weak. What to look out for: The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) is expected to downgrade the 2% GDP growth it was expecting for 2017 back in March to about 1.5%. Growth expectations for the next four years are also likely to be lowered.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

The hearing on Wednesday, six years after he was forced from office, follows his success at forging a winning coalition out of his centre-right Forza Italia and two far-right parties \u2013 the Northern League and Brothers of Italy \u2013 in regional elections in Sicily earlier this month. The outcome of the ballot on the southern Italian island was largely seen as a rehearsal for how things might play out in national elections, which must be held before May next year. It also marked the beginning of an authentic political comeback for the 81-year-old, despite being plagued by a tax fraud conviction, sex scandals and allegations of corruption. Considering the length of time it takes for the court to deliver a verdict, it is unlikely to come before the general elections. The current five-year term for the Italian government officially expires on 15 March, although the vote could be held as late as May. \u201cI hope that the Strasbourg court will accept my appeal,\u201d Berlusconi wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. \u201cBut my role in the next electoral campaign is clear regardless: I will be in the field looking to take the centre-right into government.\u201d The billionaire, who was forced to resign from his third term as prime minister in 2011 over claims he paid for sex with an underage sex worker, has hired top lawyers from London\u2019s Doughty Street Chambers to fight his case.

But when the Huddersfield contemporary music festival began, in 1978, the situation was much worse, with no annual showcase here for what living composers were producing. That such an event took root in an unprepossessing West Yorkshire industrial town in the late 70s was remarkable in itself, especially when most of the activity in new music then was centred on London. What began on a modest scale under the aegis of Huddersfield Polytechnic (now the University of Huddersfield) \u2013 where the festival\u2019s tireless founding director, Richard Steinitz, was a lecturer in music \u2013 grew quickly into one of the most important dates in the British musical calendar. The HCMF really hit its stride in the early 80s, hosting a series of important premieres alongside residencies from many of the senior figures of postwar music, from Olivier Messiaen and Terry Riley to Hans Werner Henze and Elliott Carter. Gradually expanding its ambition and range, Steinitz\u2019s programming was never narrowly doctrinal; from the early days, he tried to reflect the spectrum of what was going on across Europe and the US. Steinitz stood down as director after the 2000 festival. The current director, Graham McKenzie, has been there for more than a decade, not only steering the programming towards new generations of composers from across Europe, but also broadening the stylistic scope, including events that touch on jazz, electronica and rock. With these changes, so the atmosphere of the festival has altered. This is partly because the generation of postwar composers whose appearances made the early festivals so memorable has all but gone, but also because, in those days, festival audiences had a sense of a shared purpose.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

It came when the trainer stated her baseline ambition for the horse. \u201cI\u2019d like to get him back to the Gold Cup because the last two Gold Cup winners haven\u2019t even got back. That\u2019s Plan A, to get him there. Whatever happens after that will be a bonus.\u201d Harrington is right about this. Neither Coneygree nor Don Cossack made it back to the Gold Cup the year after winning it. This is part of being a top-class staying chaser, in my view; in most cases, you only get a year at the top. Winning a race like that comes at a cost, which can be that the winner is either unwilling or incapable of a reprise. \u201cMy only worry,\u201d Harrington continued, \u201cis maybe the three hard races last year might leave a mark on him. But he\u2019d had a good few hard races the year before and he seemed to come out of it very well.\u201d Sizing John is only seven, rising eight, and he looked a picture yesterday.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had provisionally found that Concordia had \u201cabused its dominant position to overcharge the NHS\u201d by hiking the price of liothyronine, used to treat patients with an underactive thyroid, by nearly 6,000% between 2007 and 2017. The regulator said the NHS had spent more than \u00a334m on the drug last year, up from about \u00a3600,000 in 2006. The amount it paid per pack rose from \u00a34.46 in 2007 to \u00a3258.19 by July 2017. The price of a single pill went up from 16p to \u00a39.22, even though production costs remained broadly stable during that period, the CMA said. Concordia could be fined up to 10% of its worldwide annual turnover. Liothyronine tablets are used to treat hypothyroidism, a condition caused by a deficiency of the thyroid hormone that affects at least two in 100 people and can lead to depression, tiredness and weight gain. For many patients there is no alternative and, until this year, Concordia was the only supplier. This summer, the UK firm Morningside Healthcare and Israel\u2019s Teva were granted licences to supply the drug.

A summary of the modelling, circulated by the government in advance of the talks with the states, suggests household power bills between 2020 and 2030 would be \u201cin the order of\u201d $120 a year lower, in today\u2019s dollars, than under a business-as-usual scenario, if the policy applied across the national electricity market. The material supplied by the government says wholesale electricity prices would be 23% lower than business-as-usual between 2020 and 2030, and it suggests the share of renewables in the market by 2030 \u201ccould range from 32% to 36%\u201d. The full modelling, undertaken for the Energy Security Board by Frontier Economics, has not yet been distributed to state energy ministers and the documents circulated in Canberra are a summary of the findings, not the work itself. The Turnbull government announced in October it would dump the clean energy target recommended by the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, and proceed with the national energy guarantee \u2013 a policy that imposes new reliability and emissions reduction guarantees on energy retailers and large energy users from 2020. The policy requires cooperation from the states but some of the Labor governments, particularly South Australia, have been hostile. Part of the reason for that is the states were involved in the exhaustive consultations with Finkel about the clean energy target but were not kept in the loop about the national energy guarantee. Some state governments are also concerned the Turnbull policy will hard-bake coal into the system at the expense of renewables at a time when the energy market needs to transition to low-emissions power sources. A spokesman for the South Australian premier, Jay Weatherill, is continuing to insist that the state will not commit to sign on to the national energy guarantee in the absence of data showing its specific impact on the state. The Labor states have also commissioned their own work through the Council of Australian Governments energy council examining whether or not they could implement a clean energy target by themselves.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

In 1998, the year before she retired, Novotn\u00e1 became only the fifth female player to pass the $10m mark in career prize money and in the same year was within reach of being ranked No 1 in the world. As an athlete she was among the best of her era, possessed of consummate skill in the dying and difficult art of serve-and-volley and an ability to deliver a backhand smash that was the envy of her peers. And yet in her 14 years at the top of the women\u2019s game she won only 24 tour singles titles. Even more disappointingly, she reached the last eight in 22 of the 50 grand slam singles events in which she competed but managed to convert that consistency into just one title. The American player and commentator Pam Shriver, who was a good friend, explained this by saying that Novotn\u00e1 was \u201cas kind as she was athletic\u201d. Others, mostly tennis writers such as myself, put it more brutally: she was a choker. Novotn\u00e1 herself said she hated the idea of choking, preferring instead to say that she \u201cgot a little tight\u201d. Her most famous episode of getting a little tight is now a case study for sports psychologists. It came in the 1993 Wimbledon final when she led Steffi Graf 6-7, 6-1, 4-1, and at 40-30 in the sixth game of the deciding set had a service point for a 5-1 lead over the German.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

Despite paying a lower dollar price for fuel, the continued weakness of sterling brought additional costs of \u00a3101m, easyJet said. The airline will also be prompted by Brexit to change its rules to ensure easyJet is majority owned and controlled by EU nationals after 2019. About a third of shares are owned by the easyJet founder, Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who has dual UK-Cypriot nationality, and will be classed as EU-owned. But easyJet will ask at its 2018 AGM for new powers to force UK shareholders to sell up if necessary to allow it to continue operating in Europe. McCall said the move was \u201ca technical, administrative thing\u201d and the airline had \u201cno concerns\u201d about getting enough EU shareholders. Shares rose by more than 5% in early trading, on the back of the airline reporting high levels of forward bookings and better revenue so far in its 2017-18 financial year, which it said was \u201cprimarily as a result of some capacity leaving the market\u201d.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

John Lewis has become a prime target for Stop Funding Hate on the back of the launch of its Christmas advert and as retailers increase their spending on advertising as the festive season approaches. Stop Funding Hate has produced a mock advert that depicts the star of last year\u2019s John Lewis Christmas advert \u2013 Buster the dog \u2013 as unhappy because the retailer is buying adverts with the Mail, Sun, and Express. The video has been shared almost 10,000 times on Twitter and Facebook. Sainsbury\u2019s, Marks &amp; Spencer and Waitrose are also being targeted by Stop Funding Hate. The organisation was founded last year and says its aim is to take on \u201cdivisive hate campaigns\u201d by the Mail, Sun and Express, and persuade advertisers to cease their financial input. Richard Wilson, the founder of Stop Funding Hate, said: \u201c[John Lewis] are a company well known for their ethical values and one that people have a lot of respect for. Customers are saying there is a clash between what the brand stands for and these newspapers. It would be great if John Lewis made a move, but another company could make a move too.\u201d However, John Lewis said it would continue advertising with the newspapers and not bow to the pressure. A spokesperson said: \u201cWithdrawing advertising on the basis of editorial coverage would be inconsistent with our democratic principles, which include freedom of speech and remaining apolitical.\u201d Paperchase announced on Monday that it would not run any marketing campaigns with the Daily Mail and said it was \u201ctruly sorry\u201d for running a front-page promotion in Saturday\u2019s edition of the newspaper.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.
