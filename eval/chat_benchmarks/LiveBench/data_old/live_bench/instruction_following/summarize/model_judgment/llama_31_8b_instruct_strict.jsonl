The crumbling, graffiti-covered buildings are overgrown with creepers. The only human visitors to the 70-acre site in Vaimaanga pay a small fee to explore what has become known as the biggest white elephant in the South Pacific. The Italian-backed hotel project, which began in the late 1980s, was designed to revolutionise tourism in the remote Cook Islands by providing the tiny nation with its first five-star resort. But the house of cards collapsed at the 11th hour, with the project 80% complete, amid allegations of mafia involvement and money laundering back in Italy. The Cook Islands government was left with a debt of $120m and was almost bankrupted. In the years since, repeated attempts to finish the project have foundered, but now a new effort to salvage the buildings is under way, and could have an even bigger impact on the tiny Pacific state than the original plans were expected to. Tim Tepaki, a Cook Islander who has been involved in property development in New Zealand, claims to have hundreds of millions of dollars in Chinese backing. He hopes to rebuild the complex and turn the Pacific backwater into a favourite destination for tourists from China. Until now tourism in the Cooks \u2013 a nation of 15 islands scattered across an area the size of India \u2013 has relied mainly on visitors from Australia and New Zealand, who tend to focus on the capital Rarotonga and the atoll of Aitutaki, a 50-minute flight north.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

Arriving in Bundaberg just as the Labor campaign left, Hanson, who remains the most visible One Nation asset in Queensland, despite not running in Saturday\u2019s state election, lashed out at Palaszczuk\u2019s continued criticism of the party. Palaszczuk\u2019s insistence that Labor would rather go into opposition than form government with One Nation has become its strongest attack line against the Liberal National party, which is directly preferencing One Nation in 50 of the 61 seats it is running in, as well as admitting, indirectly, it would form government with One Nation, if necessary.

Soutphommasane used a speech at the University of Western Sydney to issue a pointed warning against adopting \u201ceasy narratives\u201d devoid of evidence about the behaviour or inclinations of particular ethnic groups in Australia. \u201cIn a world that many describe as post-truth or post-factual, our social cohesion is not always well served by jumping to conclusions,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce-appealing narratives take hold, they can help fuel stereotypes about others \u2013 and these can be difficult to shake off. Sometimes this is because they may conveniently help to confirm cultural hierarchies in our society.\u201d Soutphommasane said a narrative has sprung up since the postal survey which centres on ethnic minorities or multicultural communities being intrinsically hostile towards same-sex marriage, and to the LGBTI community at large. He said while some ethnic communities hold to the view that marriage is between a man and a woman, that view is shaped often by religious or cultural traditions. The race commissioner said a more clear-eyed examination of the postal survey data suggests religiosity, or religious observance, was a more significant factor for no voters \u2013 a fact well understood by the no campaign, which targeted messages to a range of communities in Sydney\u2019s west. Soutphommasane said if you look at the voting trends outside western Sydney, a more mixed picture emerges \u2013 a picture where seats with populations of more than 40% born overseas overwhelmingly voted yes. He pointed out that the most multicultural electorates in New South Wales and Victoria recorded high yes votes \u2013 seats like Sydney, Grayndler, Kingsford Smith, Bradfield, Batman, Wills, Gellibrand and Chisholm. \u201cTo suggest that an overwhelming majority of multicultural communities voted no \u2013 and did so out of some essential cultural hostility against gays and lesbians \u2013 is to entertain something that comes close to an unkind stereotype,\u201d the race commissioner said.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

A bigger shock would have been to hear that he was staying on. Nevertheless, on the surface, his decision to leave the Socceroos a week after overseeing their qualification for the 2018 World Cup in Russia doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense. Though it may be disingenuous on his part \u2013 given that he would have been heavily involved in all manner of discussions with Postecoglou over the past weeks and, indeed, years \u2013 even Football Federation Australia CEO David Gallop conceded this morning that he too was \u201cpuzzled\u201d by it. For most of us in the cheap seats it does indeed seem odd. You go to the back-breaking trouble of tearing down and then rebuilding a playing style in-line with an aspirational philosophy, you scour the world for overlooked Australian talent, you soak through business shirts from Kazakhstan to Bangkok, and you make yourself the target of the slings and arrows of both outrageous fortune and look-at-me punditry; and you do this all in the hope of steering your team to the World Cup finals, football\u2019s biggest stage. But then just when you\u2019ve done the hardest bit, just when you\u2019ve got them over the line despite all the public challenges and personal sacrifices along the way, you chuck it all in. This isn\u2019t the way these things normally happen. Coaches resign all the time, of course, but usually only when they notice the axe glinting above their heads.

Medics are so scared of being complained about that they are also giving patients more tests than their symptoms merit and not performing procedures that involve more risk than usual. Four out of five doctors who become the subject of a complaint find the experience so stressful that they start practising more \u201cdefensive medicine\u201d than before, according to a survey of 6,144 doctors in Britain about whom a patient, relative or colleague had complained. \u201cThis involved \u2018hedging\u2019, which includes performing more tests than necessary, over-referral and overprescribing as well as \u2018avoidance\u2019, which includes avoiding procedures, not accepting high-risk patients or abandoning procedures early,\u201d according to research by a team led by Prof Tom Bourne of Imperial College London, whose findings have been published in the journal BMJ Open. \u201cThese behaviours may have a serious impact on patient care,\u201d they warned. While litigation, complaints and investigations are intended to protect patients from poor care and medical negligence, the \u201cburden and stress associated with these processes are clearly having unintended consequences and it may be argued that when examined as a whole, these structures may be causing more harm to patient care than good,\u201d the study said. \u201cWhile the regulatory system may protect patients from the misconduct of a relatively small number of doctors, it has a perverse effect on the majority of doctors who become preoccupied by defensive practice,\u201d it added. Doctors who resort to \u201cfear-driven working practices that could compromise patient care\u201d also waste vital resources and their conduct \u201ccreates significant costs for the NHS\u201d, the co-authors added. Bourne could not quantify how much NHS spending goes on that, but pointed to a study that found such practices accounted for 10% of Italy\u2019s health budget.

The disputes are not over the desirability of public ownership (both sides support it). Nor are they, in any serious sense, about electricity prices (no one can reduce them by much). They aren\u2019t even about jobs, or rather, they are more about what kinds of jobs we want to create than about the number that will be created. Paradoxically, the closest parallel to the current debate is not over energy or economics it all. Rather it is the bitter culture war over equal marriage. Faced with a trend which has swept almost the entire developed world and seems certain to prevail everywhere in time, the supporters of coal are seeking to delay the inevitable.

At a press conference in Adelaide on Wednesday, Kakoschke-Moore announced she had received advice from the UK Home Office on Friday, confirmed by a specialist barrister, that she had received British citizenship from her mother, who was born in Singapore in 1957. Kakoschke-Moore had always believed she was not British because her father had received advice from the British embassy in Oman she was not eligible for citizenship when she was 12. She said she was \u201cheartbroken\u201d to discover she was British, which she described as \u201cextremely surprising\u201d because she \u201chad no reason to believe I was a British citizen until that point\u201d.

The UNHCR also revealed accommodation for the refugees and asylum seekers is still not fully constructed, more than three weeks after the detention centre was officially closed and Australia\u2019s immigration minister Peter Dutton said community housing was ready for detainees. It came as Papua New Guinea police and immigration deferred a joint operation to \u201cpolitely\u201d request the men to leave the centre ahead of a supreme court appeal case on Wednesday afternoon. The police commissioner, Gari Baki, said Operation Helpim Friends, was on hold pending the outcome of the case, filed on behalf of the refugees and asylum seekers. He earlier pledged the operation \u2013 assisted by the paramilitary police mobile squad \u2013 would use no force, but refugees \u201cwill be asked politely to pack up and voluntarily leave the centre\u201d. Nai Jit Lam, UNHCR\u2019s deputy regional representative in Canberra, made the comments from Manus Island in a briefing to the UN Palais des Nations in Geneva. Lam told the international community the situation on Manus was \u201cvery serious and deteriorating by the day\u201d. About 380 men are inside the former detention facility without food, running water or medical care, saying they fear for their safety in the Lorengau community. There have been frequent attacks on detainees and well-documented tensions with locals. Inside the centre the situation was \u201cdesperate\u201d, and outside, where authorities claim the men have accommodation and services waiting for them, it is \u201cprofoundly inadequate\u201d, Lam said.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

She wants it stubbed out, for good, on the basis that Gallic heroes puffing away on the silver screen makes the filthy habit seem cool and provides the evil tobacco industry with free advertising. Ban it, and everything will be made miraculously better \u2013 c\u2019est simple. Her call has been taken up by the health minister, Agn\u00e8s Buzyn, and suddenly film-makers have a fight on their hands. The problem with this is that it totally ignores the venerable history of French cinema, which plays out as a long, drawn-out visual love letter to the act of smoking. Smoking a cigarette and cinema have always gone perfectly together \u2013 they are both ways of killing time, after all \u2013 but the moving image also captures the act of smoking so much better than other art forms, such as still photography. The flare of a match or lighter, and then the upward curl of smoke are forever seductive. All the best French film directors knew this and have exploited it endlessly. Think of virtually any famous French film and cigarettes are an essential ingredient. Jean-Luc Godard\u2019s \u00c0 Bout de Souffle (Breathless) opens with Jean-Paul Belmondo driving and smoking, a fag dangling from his lower lip, and for the next 90 minutes he chainsmokes his way through the entire story until, shot in the back, he runs away, still puffing, to collapse and die on the street.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

Ruddock\u2019s appointment by cabinet, announced on Wednesday, is designed to head off a bruising debate about religious amendments in a same-sex marriage bill, but the treasurer, Scott Morrison, said the review was \u201cno substitute\u201d for those amendments. The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said it was important to look at the issue of religious freedom carefully, in light of the yes vote and impending legislation on marriage equality. While senior conservatives including Peter Dutton and Mathias Cormann have publicly suggested a religious freedom bill can be considered next year, separately to a marriage bill, others including Morrison and Liberal senator, David Fawcett, have insisted it be considered at the same time. Ruddock has been asked to report by 31 March. Turnbull said a variety of proposals for legislative changes to protect freedom of religion have been put forward in recent months but many of them go beyond the immediate issue of marriage, and parliament needed to be wary of them. \u201cAny reforms to protect religious freedom at large should be undertaken carefully,\u201d he said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cThere is a high risk of unintended consequences when parliament attempts to legislate protections for basic rights and freedoms, such as freedom of religion. The government is particularly concerned to prevent uncertainties caused by generally worded bill of rights-style declarations. \u201cThis will be a timely expert stocktake to inform consideration of any necessary legislative reforms.\u201d Turnbull said Ruddock was the right person to conduct the review because he had served as Australia\u2019s special envoy for human rights.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

When it comes to sports, Trump\u2019s targets are often African American, and he pursued a few such targets this week. Regular readers may remember that when last week the president asked China to free three UCLA basketball players accused of shoplifting, his main concern was that the players would thank him, which they did. But when LaVar Ball, the father of one of the arrested players and an inveterate attention seeker himself, questioned just how critical a role Trump actually played, it enraged the president. \u201cI should have left them in jail!\u201d he tweeted on Sunday, adding six hours later that he \u201cshould have gotten his son [LiAngelo Ball] out during my next trip to China instead \u2026 Very ungrateful!\u201d Trump \u2013 whose sons Donald Jr and Eric are well-known hunters \u2013 also gave more clues about his perhaps surprisingly critical views on the US Fish and Wildlife Service plan to allow imports of elephant trophies from Zimbabwe and Zambia, tweeting: \u201cBig-game trophy decision will be announced next week but will be very hard pressed to change my mind that this horror show in any way helps conservation of Elephants or any other animal.\u201d Monday Returning to his racially tinged offensive, Trump singled out Marshawn Lynch of the Oakland Raiders for sitting down during the playing of The Star-Spangled Banner. \u201cGreat disrespect!\u201d tweeted the president, adding another dog whistle for the base when he pointed out that Lynch had stood up \u201cfor the Mexican anthem\u201d. Black athletes have been protesting during the national anthem since the summer, to highlight police violence and racial injustice. Tuesday Sexual misconduct accusations against the Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore are a less divisive issue, at least outside Alabama \u2013 Moore has been condemned widely, including by numerous GOP figures. But after some prevaricating Trump came down on the candidate\u2019s side. Asked the memorable question \u201cIs Roy Moore, [allegedly] a child molester, better than a Democrat?\u201d, Trump pointed out that Moore denied the claims against him, one of which involves a woman who was 14 at the time, and said: \u201cI can tell you one thing for sure: we don\u2019t need a liberal person in there, a Democrat.\u201d Trump has himself been accused by numerous women of sexual harassment.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

Two of her best and most memorable works, which reveal her father\u2019s influence, are a striking self-portrait from 1954, and a 1957 portrait of Stanley himself. She had three solo shows of her paintings in London, and contributed to many mixed exhibitions, from the London Group to the Royal Academy shows. The first of her one-person shows was at Lauderdale House in Highgate, in 1993, the second at the Boundary Gallery in St John\u2019s Wood in 2001, both in north London, but it was the third that really established her reputation. In 2015, the Fine Art Society in Bond Street mounted the first West End exhibition of her work, to coincide with the publication of her autobiography, Lucky to Be an Artist. Fifty of her paintings from all periods were shown along with her etchings, accompanied by a group of pictures by her family: works by her parents, her uncles Gilbert Spencer and Richard Carline, and by her grandfather George Carline. This show came at the suggestion of a friend, the painter David Inshaw. He recalled visiting her house in Clapham (where, according to her son, she had inscribed \u201cDaring, Joy and Love\u201d on her bedroom wall), expecting to find it hung with paintings by herself and her parents. But the walls were oddly bare, with not even her own work in sight. The public has always been more interested in the Spencer/Carline family\u2019s eccentric lifestyle than in the art produced and Unity spent a substantial part of her life explaining if not defending her parents.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

The furniture maker, which employs 547 people in 50 shops and manufactures upholstered furnishings in Thetford, Norfolk, has struggled amid a tough retail market in which shoppers are shying away from spending on expensive items for their homes. Multiyork had reportedly been put on the market by its major shareholder, the furnishings tycoon Charles Wade of Wade Furniture Group, which also owns beds maker Feather &amp; Black. The two brands are run as separate entities and the administration does not include the bed maker. Administrators said that Multiyork has fallen into financial difficulties as it could not meet its financial liabilities as a result of trading losses. The company had net debt of \u00a31.9m at its 2016 year end, according to the latest accounts filed at Companies House. It recorded a profit of just \u00a3479,000 in the 53 weeks to 2 October 2016 after a \u00a3714,000 loss a year before.

In the late 1970s I was one of the first computer studies teachers. Our secondary school started with one microcomputer and 90 pupils taking computer studies as an option subject. The computer was booked solidly from early morning to night-time so pupils could access the exciting new technology for their coursework, which was 100% programming. Pupils of all abilities were totally engaged with the practical side of the course and derived huge satisfaction from even the simplest of programs. It was also unique in providing an outlet for the brightest pupils to stretch themselves, with future Oxbridge students working at projects way beyond the understanding of their teachers. Then, as the years passed by, came the educational \u201cexperts\u201d who decided that learning IT skills (how to use PowerPoint, Word, Excel etc) was the way forward and computer studies courses became a thing of the past. Without a doubt, had computing courses expanded in line with the development of the technology, Britain could have been leading the world, not sitting marvelling at what children in other countries can produce. Bob Epton Brigg, Lincolnshire \u2022 John Harris addresses an important issue: of course school computer education ought always to have been about much more than PowerPoint.

But perhaps it\u2019s more the fact that he doesn\u2019t want to \u2013 or can\u2019t \u2013 admit to himself that, while he toys with the idea of a girlfriend and tools around with his delinquent buddies, he is drawn, time and again, to gay hook-up websites in search of older men. The Brooklyn summer of Eliza Hittman\u2019s superb second feature is an endless fairground ride of cheap highs and long, dragging, wasted moments. Escape comes in pill form, filched by Frankie from the stock of prescription medication intended to take the sharp edges off his dying father\u2019s pain. Frankie and his boys bask like lizards, shirtless and heavy-lidded as they eye the girls on the beach. Hittman shares something of Claire Denis\u2019s gift for finding vulnerability in a chiselled male body and a kind of bruised poetry in the tough-guy swagger of these teenage kids. But it\u2019s to Dickinson that the watchful camera always returns. British by birth, but utterly persuasive in the skin of this Brooklyn-born lost boy, he is undoubtedly one of the discoveries of the year. There\u2019s a wounded beauty to his performance; he captures the kind of tortured inarticulacy that speaks volumes.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

The Metropolitan police said on Wednesday they were looking into the fresh claims against the Hollywood actor, having opened an investigation into similar allegations against him earlier this month. According to the latest allegations, Spacey sexually assaulted a man, identified only as Victim 2, in 2005. The claims were referred to the Met by City of London police last Friday, Scotland Yard said. The earlier claims related to an alleged sexual assault perpetrated against a man identified as Victim 1 in 2008 and were referred by the same force. Each was allegedly committed in the Lambeth area of south London and, in each case, police refused to name the suspect. However, officers did confirm that each was made against the same man and he is understood to be Spacey. \u201cOfficers from the child abuse and sexual offences command are investigating,\u201d the Met said on Wednesday.

And yet it\u2019s hard to avoid heaving a thankful sigh when Arisen My Senses, the opening track of her ninth studio album, Utopia, crashes into life: birdsong giving way to bright splashes of electronics, beatific-sounding harp chords and cascading beats not unlike the oft-sampled rhythm track of Schoolly D\u2019s old rap classic PSK, What Does It Mean? It sounds positively ecstatic, which comes as a relief. Utopia\u2019s predecessor, 2015\u2019s Vulnicura, was a remarkable record, a latterday entry into the canon of legendary break-up albums. It attained its place alongside Marvin Gaye\u2019s Here, My Dear and Dylan\u2019s Blood on the Tracks by setting its fathomless misery to atonal string arrangements and abstract electronics that, during its central track, kept vanishing into a single flatlining beep. It was raw, brave, challenging, unique and all the other adjectives heaped on it in reviews, but with the best will in the world, any album so harrowing that the appearance of gloom-laden vocalist Anohni constitutes a moment of light relief is going to be one that defies you to listen to it repeatedly. Utopia reanimates Vulnicura\u2019s collaboration with Venezuela-born electronic auteur Arca, but is made of lighter material. Aside from his endlessly shifting soundscapes, distorted beats and penchant for sonic tapestries made from manipulated vocal samples, the album\u2019s primary sound is woodwind, provided by an assembly of 12 female flautists from Reykjavik, which automatically lends it a far airier quality than the claustrophobic Vulnicura. It is, Bj\u00f6rk says, her \u201cTinder album\u201d, and its advance billing as a kind of Songs for Swinging Bachelorettes is borne out by its lyrics, which are obsessed both with technology and the vicissitudes of budding romance. \u201cIs this excess texting blessing?\u201d ponders Blissing Me, the saga of \u201ctwo music nerds \u2026 sending each other MP3s\u201d, before reverting to grief: \u201cour physical union a fantasy, I just fell in love with a song\u201d.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

The Simon Langton grammar school for boys in Canterbury, which caused controversy last year when it invited its former pupil Milo Yiannopoulos, the rightwing controversialist, to speak, sparked fresh concerns this week with a new debating forum that it said was designed to be \u201can antidote to the poison of political correctness\u201d.

The summit between the three powers, all deeply involved in the conflict, is designed to pave the way for a settlement likely to leave Syria\u2019s Russian- and Iranian-backed president, Bashar al-Assad, in power within a reformed Syrian constitution. It follows the near-collapse of the Syrian opposition since Moscow\u2019s armed intervention in 2015 and the military defeat of Islamic State in all of the major towns and cities that were under its control. \u201cThe militants in Syria have sustained a decisive blow and now there is a realistic chance to end the multi-year civil war,\u201d Putin declared as he hosted Iran\u2019s Hassan Rouhani and Turkey\u2019s Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan in Sochi. \u201cThe Syrian people will have to determine their own future and agree on the principles of their own statehood. It is obvious that the process of reform will not be easy and will require compromises and concessions from all participants, including of course the government of Syria.\u201d Putin hosted Assad in Sochi on Monday and extracted a more emollient tone than normal. He insisted on Wednesday that Assad was committed to a peace process, constitutional reform and free elections. The Russian leader also held a frantic round of telephone diplomacy with other world leaders including Saudi Arabia\u2019s King Salman, Israel\u2019s Benjamin Netanyahu and Donald Trump. Putin urged Iran and Turkey to start a discussion with him on the reconstruction of Syria. \u201cGiven the colossal scale of the destruction it would be possible to think together about the development of a comprehensive program for Syria,\u201d he said.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

New research from the disability charity Scope has found almost half of working-age disabled people are chronically lonely, saying they \u201calways or often\u201d feel lonely. Staggeringly, that works out at about 3 million lonely disabled people in Britain. The Office for National Statistics has described Britain as \u201cthe loneliness capital of Europe\u201d \u2013 finding that we\u2019re less likely to have strong friendships or know our neighbours than inhabitants of any other country in the EU.

It didn\u2019t deal in black humour in the latterday manner of Human Remains or Nighty Night \u2013 there was sharp, witty writing, slapstick humour, it dabbled in farce \u2013 but equally, there was no mistaking the way every episode was shot through with wistfulness, nostalgia and regret.

And given the news that growth had been downgraded to 1.5% and the low forecasts for growth stretching out until 2022, Philip Hammond needed all the laughs he could get. Things didn\u2019t go brilliantly in the run-up to the speech. First up, people noticed how the Treasury team didn\u2019t quite manage to pull off a tribute to the Beatles\u2019 Abbey Road album cover. Then the chancellor got stuck in traffic on the way from Downing Street to the House of Commons. Behind a white van with a Europhile logo. This came days after he avoided another potentially awkward vehicle-related photo op as a passenger in a self-driving car. There may have been a U-turn on taking that car trip, but Hammond didn\u2019t back away from mentioning self-driving vehicles in his speech. \u201cI know that Jeremy Clarkson doesn\u2019t like them, but there are also other reasons to pursue this technology,\u201d he said, going on to indulge in some wordplay about Clarkson\u2019s fellow Grand Tour presenters, suggesting it was \u201cnot the first time you\u2019ve been snubbed by Hammond and May\u201d. The line went down well in some quarters.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.  Your answer must contain exactly 5 bullet points.

Hans Bunting, the chief operating officer of renewables at Innogy SE, part of the company that owns the UK energy supplier npower, said offshore windfarms had become mainstream and were destined to become even cheaper because of new, bigger turbines. Asked whether nuclear groups that want to build new reactors in the UK could compete with windfarms on cost, even when their intermittency was taken into account, Bunting replied: \u201cObviously they can\u2019t.\u201d His comments came after MPs criticised the \u00a330bn cost to consumers for EDF Energy\u2019s Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, and said ministers should revisit the case for new nuclear before proceeding with more projects. Innogy recently secured a subsidy of \u00a374.75 per megawatt hour of power to build a windfarm off the Lincolnshire coast, which is \u00a317.75 cheaper than Hinkley and should be completed about three years earlier. \u201cWhat we see now [with prices] is with today\u2019s technology. It\u2019s not about tomorrow\u2019s technology, which is about [to come in] 2025, 2027, when Hinkley will most likely come to the grid ... and then it [windfarms] will be even cheaper.\u201d While the company is planning to use the most powerful turbines in the world today for the Lincolnshire windfarm, Bunting said even bigger ones in development would drive costs down further. \u201cA few years ago everyone thought 10MW [turbines] was the maximum, now we\u2019re talking about 15[MW]. It seems the sky is the limit,\u201d he said. \u201c[It] means less turbines for the same capacity, less steel in the ground, less cables, even bigger rotors catching more wind, so it will become cheaper.\u201d However, EDF argued that nuclear was also on a path to lower costs. \u201cEarly offshore wind projects started at around \u00a3150 per MW/h and developers have shown they can offer lower prices by repeating projects with an established supply chain \u2013 the same is true for nuclear,\u201d an EDF spokesman said.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.
